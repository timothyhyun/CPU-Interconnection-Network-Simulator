Computer Architecture Design and Simulation - Simulator

This repository contains a multi-component integrated simulator to support
computer architecture students writing simulation models of different
computer architecture components, such as caches, branch predictors, or
coherence protocols.  The provided code handles trace reading and
initialization of simple components.
